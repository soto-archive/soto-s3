For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf from the bucket awsexamplebucket, use awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL encoded.   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format arn:aws:s3:&lt;Region&gt;:&lt;account-id&gt;:accesspoint/&lt;access-point-name&gt;/object/&lt;key&gt;. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through the access point my-access-point owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf.
